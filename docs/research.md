		- Withdrawal Amount: $5,280
		- Withholding Tax: $0 (There is no immediate tax taken on the minimum amount).
		- Cash in Hand: $5,280
	- *Scenario B: Taking More Than the Minimum*
		- The Minimum Portion: $5,280 (Tax withheld: $0)
		- The "Excess" Amount: $14,720 (20000 - 5280)
		- On the first $5,000: 10% tax = $500
		- On the next $9,720: 20% tax = $1,944

- Taxed only on the profit made
- No contribution limits
- Used by people when they exceed the limit of TFSA
- Taxation triggered by
	- Annualy: Taxed every year on flow-through income like interest, dividends and reinvested fund gains
		- If $100 profit earned and if you reinvest it agian, you still owe tax on the $100 profit made at the end of the year
	- When Sold: Growth (Stocks) is tax free until sold
		- If the protfolio grows from $10K to $50K in that year and was not sold, then the tax to pay is $0
- A person with 30% tax bracket (a typical middle-income rate in Canada) who earned $1000 in each investment
	- *Scenario A: Interest (The "Salary" Treatment)*
		- The Investment: You put money in a Wealthsimple Cash account or a GIC.
		- The Profit: You earn $1,000 in interest.
		- How it's Taxed: 100% of that $1,000 is added to your income.
		- The Math: $1,000 × 30% tax rate = $300 Tax Bill.
		- Cash in Hand: $700.
	- *Scenario B: Foreign Dividends (The "Global" Hit)*
		- The Investment: You buy shares of a US company like Apple or NVIDIA.
		- The Profit: They pay you $1,000 in dividends.
		- How it's Taxed: Similar to interest, 100% is added to your income. Plus, the US government often takes a 15% "Withholding Tax" before it even reaches Wealthsimple (though you can usually claim a Foreign Tax Credit to avoid being taxed twice).
		- The Math: $1,000 × 30% tax rate = $300 Tax Bill.
		- Cash in Hand: $700.
	- *Scenario C: Canadian Dividends (The "Home-Grown" Discount)*
		- The Investment: You buy shares of a Canadian bank (like TD) or a utility (like Enbridge).
		- The Profit: You earn $1,000 in "Eligible Dividends."
		- How it's Taxed: It's complicated math (you "gross up" the amount to $1,380, calculate tax, then apply a credit), but the result is a lower rate than your salary.
		- The Math: For a 30% bracket, your effective tax rate on these might only be ~15%.
		- Estimated Tax Bill: $150.
		- Cash in Hand: $850.
	- *Scenario D: Capital Gains (The "50% Off" Sale)*
		- The Investment: You buy an ETF at Wealthsimple for $10,000 and sell it later for $11,000.
		- The Profit: You have a $1,000 capital gain.
		- How it's Taxed: Only 50% ($500) of that profit is taxable. The other $500 is completely tax-free.
		- The Math: $500 (Taxable portion) × 30% tax rate = $150 Tax Bill.
		- Cash in Hand: $850.

**Life Insurance (context, not an account)**

- Money goes directly to the person named as beneficiary, is not controlled by Will.
- Money doesn't go to estate, so no probate fees (up to 1.5% in Ontario)
- The benficiary gets every single dollar at payout.

**The People Involved**
*Beneficiary* 
	- The person who receives the account's money when you die. Named on a form, bypasses your will entirely. Faster, often cheaper, often better tax outcome.

*Successor Holder* 
	- Only for TFSAs. A special designation for a spouse or common-law partner that transfers the entire account when the sole account holder dies — including its tax-free status and contribution room — directly to them. Superior to just naming a spouse as beneficiary.

*Successor Annuitant* 
	- Only for RRSPs and RRIFs. When you name your spouse as this, they step into your shoes and continue the account as if it were always theirs, deferring all tax.

*Estate*
	- Everything you own at death. Your house, car, bank accounts, investment accounts with no beneficiary. Goes through probate (a legal process that's slow, public, and costs money).

*Probate*
	- The court process that validates your will and gives your executor legal authority to distribute your estate. Takes months. Costs 1-1.5% of your estate value in most provinces. Publicly visible. Accounts with named beneficiaries bypass this entirely.

*Executor*
	- The person you name in your will to carry out your wishes after death.

*Common-law partner*
	- In Canada, someone you've lived with in a conjugal relationship for 12 months or more (or immediately if you have a child together). Has many of the same rights as a married spouse for tax purposes.

*Dependent*
	- Someone who relies on you financially. Minor children and financially dependent adult children have special rights in some provinces.
